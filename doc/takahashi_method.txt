= Overview

'Takahashi method' is a presentation way to use huge size of text.
It is quite impressive so that I write the generator for Juli.

If you are not familiar with Takahashi method, please read the followings:

* <a href='http://www.rubycolor.org/takahashi/'>Original Site</a>
  (in Japanese)
* <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method'>Wikipedia</a>
* http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/09/living_large_ta.html

== Feature
Juli implementation of Takahashi method has the following features:

* fast &amp; easy input by your favorite editor.
* Juli wiki formatting (RD like).
* resonable disk consumption (because it's just text file).
* style and color of any element (e.g. header, list, text) can be changed
  by CSS.

= How to generate

Commandline is as follows:

  $ juli gen -g takahashi_method -t takahashi_method.html -o <i>output_path</i> <i>wikiname</i>.txt

-o option is not required.

= Navigation

* Mouse click or Right(→) key to go to the next page.
* Left(←) key to go to the previous page.

= How Juli Markup is treated in takahashi_method

One page in Takahashi method slideshow is:

* header (=, ==, ..., in text)
* paragraph (text separated by blank line)
* list item
* blockquote

== Example
I'll show two documents generated from the same slidy.txt as follows:

* slidy
* <a href='slidy_takahashi_method_version.shtml'>slidy (Takahashi method version)</a>

Both are generated as follows.
You can see them in Rakefile of Juli source package:

  $ (cd doc; juli gen -g slidy -t slidy.html slidy.txt)
  $ (cd doc; juli gen -g takahashi_method -t takahashi_method.html \
    -o ../doc_html/slidy_takahashi_method_version.shtml slidy.txt)
