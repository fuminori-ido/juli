Please see Configuration section.

== Purpose

* write my idea at anytime anyplace.
* view outline.
* link each memo together by wiki
* browse via web

== Feature

== Juli Document Syntax

Juli document syntax is similar to rd.


=== Header

Beggining '=' in line means header.  6 level headers can be used as follows:

1. '= Top level header title'
1. '== Second level header title'
1. '=== 3rd level header title'
1. '==== 4th level header title'
1. '===== 5th level header title'
1. '====== 6th level header title'

Example:


  = NAME
  juli    - Outline processor

  = SYNOPSIS
  juli [-g generator] file

will be what you see at the top of this page...

=== List
==== Ordered List

The line starts with "1. " (One dot space) is recognized as ordered list.
Not only '1' but also any number can be used.  However, actual assigned
numbers for ordered-list starts '1' and increments 1 for each. 

Example:

  1. Hello
  1. World

will be:

1. Hello
1. World

Restriction:

1. nest is not supported yet.
1. continous line is not supported yet.

==== Unordered List

The line starts with "* " (astarisk space) is recognized as unordered list.

Example:

  * Hello
  * World

will be:

* Hello
* World

Restriction:

1. nest is not supported yet.
1. continous line is not supported yet.

==== Dictionary List

The line with the following form is recognized as dictionary list:

  term:: description

Example:

  Ruby::  programing language, or a gem

will be:

Ruby::  programing language, or a gem

=== Block Quote

The line with leading spaces is recognized as blockquote.
Example:

  |   "The load to hell is paved with good intentions."
  |   -- derived proverb from original thought of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux

will be:

  "The load to hell is paved with good intentions."
  -- derived proverb from original thought of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux

(Where, '|' above is to avoid deleting spaces.  Please ignore it.)

=== HTML Extention

HTML tag can be written anyplace so you can use any html as follows:

* <i>Italic</i> by &lt;i&gt;Italic&lt;/i&gt;
* <b>Bold</b> by &lt;b&gt;Bold&lt;/b&gt;
* <s>Strikethrough</s> by &lt;s&gt;Strikethrough&lt;/s&gt;

==== Restriction

You can use any HTML. However, <b>juli markup syntax is higher priority</b>.
So, for example, tag nesting doesn't work because leading space at line is
recognized as blockquote.

Bad Example:

  |&lt;table&gt;
  |  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  |  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  |&lt;/table&gt;

(Where, '|' above is to avoid deleting spaces.  Please ignore it.)
