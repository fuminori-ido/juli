= Overview

Compete PowerPoint!(^_^)

Slidy is an another way for presentation by Juli.

Juli slidy is inspired from
<a href='http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/'>Asciidoc</a> \{slidy}.
See http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/ also.

This slideshow is generated by slidy generator.  Please go to next
page by mouse clicking or → cursor key.

= How to generate

Commandline is as follows:

  $ juli gen -g slidy -t slidy.html <i>wikiname</i>.txt

※ slidy generator doesn't support bulk-mode since it doesn't make sense.
As you can see source (lib/juli/visitor/slidy.rb), it is very small.

= Navigation

* Mouse click or Right(→) key to go to the next page.
* Left(←) key to go to the previous page.

= Markup

Juli slidy markup follows Juli Wiki Formatting, of course.
See index.

Level 1 header is a slide page.  Lower level of headers are shown
in the same page as follows:

== Level 2 header
Level 2 header
=== Level 3 header
Level 3 header

= Markup(2)

As explained already, HTML can be written in Juli so that any
image and table can be written as follows:

<img src="http://www.freeimageslive.co.uk/files/images006/bamboo_pattern.thumbnail.jpg"
alt="stock image " width="125" height="125" border="0" />

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>A</th><th>B</th></tr>
<tr><th>C</th><td>D</td><td>E</td></tr>
</table>

= Advantage

* Small file size (this slidy document is &lt; 2k bytes!)
* Fast and easy input

= Restriction

Juli slidy has minumum functionality currently to navigate pages.
Other functionalities, for example we can see in Asciidoc as follows,
are not yet supported:

* Incremental elements (e.g. Asciidoc \{slidy}).
* NOTE icon, Important icon.
* ...
