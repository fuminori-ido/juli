to embed photo in Juli wiki textfile under Unix/Linux environment.

This has the following features:

1. small photo embed in juli wiki.
1. show large photo by clicking the small photo.
1. eliminate Exif information
1. protect private photo from internet access; only photos called
   by this macro are allowed public access.
1. (TBD) link to Google map by photo's GPS info.

== How to use

Example: 

  \{photo 2012-04-22/DCIM/101_PANA/P1010441.JPG}

In general, in Juli wiki text, write as follows:

  \{photo a/b/c.jpg}

Where, a/b/c.jpg is a relative-path of the photo file from 'storage'
directory (see 'setup' section below).

As you see this example, by clicking this small photo,
you can see large photo.

These features are done by this macro.

== Architecture

Following figure shows the architecture of photo macro
and the step how it is interpreted by juli.

<center><img src='photo(macro)/architecture_1.png'></center>

Where,

* 'output_top' above is the juli configuration parameter specified in .juli/config
  for HTML generated document top directory.
  See juli(1) and/or tutorial.
* 'photo.storages' above is configuration parameter in this macro
  for all of your photo master file directory which may include
  some private photos.  Of course, only photos you specify in
  \\{photo ...} macro are copied to public_photo as above figure shows.
  See 'Setup' section below.
* 'photo.mount' is deprecated since v2.2.0

== Setup

1. For images in juli, use local photo directory and/or AWS S3.
   We call it 'photo.storages' in this macro.
   Maintenace of the 'photo.storages' is up to you.
1. In .juli/config, setup photo related entries like the followings:
    photo:
      storages:
      - kind:       local
        dir:        /home/wells/photo
      - kind:       aws
        params:
          region:   ap-northeast-1
          profile:  juli
        bucket:     juli
        prefix:     photo
      small:
        width:      512
        style:      '...'
      large:
        width:      1024

Where, each key means as follows:

storages[].kind::
  either 'local' or 'aws'
storages[].dir::
  Top directory of photos when kind == 'local'.
  It is usually photo master file directory, photo uploade directory, or
  SD-card back-up directory on your PC.
  It SHOULD be NON-PUBLIC directory to protect annonymous
  access from web.
  It SHOULD NOT be under JULI_REPO because any files except wikipage
  under JULI_REPO are copied to output_top ( = public).
  Relative path can be used, which is relative from JULI_REPO, not
  from .juli/config.
  Example: /home/wells/photo
storages[].params::
  S3 access information when kind == 'aws'.
storages[].bucket::
  S3 bucket name when kind == 'aws'.
storages[].prefix::
  (not used now)
small::
  small photo related configurations.  See below for the detail.
small.width::
  Small photo's width you like.
  Default is 512 pixel.
small.style::
  Small photo's style sheet.
  'img.juli_photo_small' entry in the
  doc/.juli/github.html file (in this package) is one of the example.
large::
  large photo related configurations.  See below for the detail.
large.width::
  Large photo's width you like.
  Default is 1024 pixel.

(Note: there is no large.style configuration now)

Please see doc/.juli/config and test/repo/.juli/config in this package
for the example.

This setup is one-shot task.

== Maintenance

When you add photo in you 'storage', just execute 'juli(1)', then
photo in the storage is copied to public site.

== Security

1. When you set 'storages[].dir', it SHOULD be out-of-url so that any photo
   under the 'dir' cannot be accessed via internet.
1. Only photo referring by this macro can be accessed via internet.

== File permission

The following permission is required on juli(1):

* write permission on output_top/public_photo/ directory.
  Where, output_top is the directory for generated HTML
  specified at .juli/config.
* read  permission under 'storage'.

== Example

=== Juli document case

<a href='#'>This document</a>'s \\{photo} macro setup is as follows:

  photo:
    storages:
    - kind:   local
      dir:    '/home/wells/photo'
    - kind:       aws
      params:
        region:   ap-northeast-1
        profile:  juli
      bucket:     juli
      prefix:     ''
    small:
      width:  200
      style:  'float: right'
