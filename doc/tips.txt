= How to customize css and js files

Original juli.css and juli.js are copied from template library to output_top
when generating HTML at first time.

You can change by the following sections.

== Modify juli.css and juli.js in your JULI_REPO

Create your customized juli.css and juli.js in your JULI_REPO.
These files are sync-ed to output_top by rsync(1) in juli(1) execution time
so that these files will be used for CSS and javascript execution.

== Specify another css and/or js file at template

You can put your own css and js in JULI_REPO and specify it at template
as follows (file names 'mine.css' and 'mine.js' below are just example):

  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
      :
      :
    &lt;script src="mine.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;link href="mine.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;


= TODO

Just run:

  $ je TODO

Then, you can:

1. add, modify, delete, re-order your TODOs ;-)
   I'm serious!!  Using your favorite editor enables you to do this.
   This is juli's feature.
1. see your TODOs on browser.
1. see your TODOs via internet if you publish to webserver (see tutorial).
1. share your TODOs (e.g. between desktop and note-PC) by git.

= bash completion for je(1)

I added the utility \{!'lib/juli/template/je-bash-complete'}.
Actually, this is not a ruby library, but bash script for je(1)
wikiname completion.  How to setup and use are described in
this file.  Enjoy!

= cron setup at web-server to update contents

sample/update_public_juli.rb is an example implementation to update
juli contents at web-server.  Please see the description in the source.

= Why juli-generated document group permission is disappeared?

== Behavior

(2013/10/19) I set juli-generated document permission 
for web server as follows:

  $ ls -l /var/www-sub/wtech.dip.jp/
  drwxr-s--- 14 MY_NAME www-data 12288 Oct 19 15:30 juli/

However, this setting is dropped as follows:

  drwxr-x--- 14 MY_NAME MY_GROUP 12288 Oct 19 15:30 juli/

== Reason

The above behavior happened because of calling rsync(1) from juli bulk_mode.
Rsync(1) copies files other than juli text from JULI_REPO to output_top
so that directory permission is also synchronized...orz

== How to fix

It is fixed by setting same group and sticky-bit at JULI_REPO.
