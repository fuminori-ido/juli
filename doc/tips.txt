This page contains several tips.

(Please add your tips here since this is wiki.
In order to do that, please contact me to grant you to write access
to this git repository.  Currently, juli code and this document are in the
same repository because it is very small for now.)

= TODO

Just run:

  $ je TODO

Then, you can:

1. add, modify, delete, re-order your TODOs ;-)
   I'm serious!!  Using your favorite editor enables you to do this.
   This is juli's feature.
1. see your TODOs on browser.
1. see your TODOs via internet if you publish to webserver (see tutorial).
1. share your TODOs (e.g. between desktop and note-PC) by git.
