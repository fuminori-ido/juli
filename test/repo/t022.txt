How about the following?:

  class Hello
    def world
      puts "Hello, World\n"
    end
    # blank line should be ok

  private
    def hoge
      # do nothing
    end
  end

1. Does the situation is the same in list?
    class Hello
      def world
        puts "Hello, World\n"
      end
      # blank line should be ok
  
    private
      def hoge
        # do nothing
      end
    end
   OK?
1. next
1. third

Done!
